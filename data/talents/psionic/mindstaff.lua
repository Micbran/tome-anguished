Mindstaff mastery: sustain styled after mindstar mastery, sustain psi cost, talent gives staff mastery bonuses (phys power and +% damage will need to change in 1.6 anyways ahhhh)
+x mag and wil based on tier of staff and +mp equal to % of staff's SP (scaling up to 100%). Maybe mind crit = to spell crit? might be over kill
offense talent: project an attack dealing x% percent weapon damage
utulity talent:
defense talent:
1) mindstaff mastery: mastery and add %SP to MP

2) resonant fields: +mag/will by staff tier, unflinching resolve but for mental/magical

3) errode mana channels: strike for % weapon damage and remove X..Y beneficial effects (sustains?). For each effect removed target takes A% more damage for B turns. Damage scales with MP and damage taken scales with SP

4) psychosomatic resilience: active skill. 1,1,2,2,3 Charges. for next X turns Y% damage you take is converted into mind damage dot over next Z turns, stacks. Scales with MP]]--
