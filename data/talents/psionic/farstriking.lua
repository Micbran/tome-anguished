Farstriking: based on projecting melee strikes at a range and procs
Farstrike: sustain that also grants another talent. Sustain gives dark damage on hit (cuz staff proc bonus so why not) and restores charges of Farstrike (guess ill need to rename the sustain huh).
Expend farstrike charges to do x% weapon damage at y range (prolly like 5-7)
Living Staff: animate staff for x turns to automatically far strike enemies in a reduced range and reduced damage(sorta like frenzied focus). Costs two far strike charges.
Dark Burst: passive, increases accuracy by x and gives a y% chance to do a conal (? kinda wanna do something more creative here) burst of darkness (for z damage) on attack. Cooldown of 3 turns.
Warding Staff: expend one (maybe two?) far strike charge(s) to block the next melee strike and knockback + stun the attacker.
